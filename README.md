# My first webserver

I'm a beginner programmer (not to say mediocre) and, according to [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning), a good first project is an HTTP server.

My objective is to make the same simple working server on C without looking for help except for the manual pages and books/articles.

I'm basing my code off of [this](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/) tutorial for python.

What I'm using to learn:

- [Letâ€™s Build A Web Server](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbaws-part1/)
- [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/split/index.html)
- [IBM's docs](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=functions-socket-create-socket)
- ChatGPT to ELI5 concepts I can't understand
